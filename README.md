Hi there! I'm Sami 👋

🚀 Self-Taught Developer | AI Enthusiast | Builder

I’m a developer who turns caffeine into code and data into insights. Currently, I'm deep-diving into the mechanics of **RAG systems** and the mathematics of uncertainty. My goal for 2026 is to launch a production-ready SaaS that solves real-world problems.


🛠️ My Tech Toolbox
- **AI/ML:** RAG Systems, Vector Databases (Pinecone/Milvus), LangChain
- **Backend:** Python.
- **Mathematics:** Stochastic Calculus & Probability

🔭 Current Focus
- 🧠 Mastering **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** for smarter LLM applications.
- 📖 Studying **Research Papers & Stochastic Calculus** to bridge the gap between theory and code.
- 🏗️ Architecting my first **SaaS platform** from the ground up.


I'm actively looking to contribute to **Open Source**! If you're working on AI tooling, financial modeling, or interesting data structures, let's talk.
